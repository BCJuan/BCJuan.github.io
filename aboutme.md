Hi! My name is Juan Borrego Carazo. I consider myself something between a programmer and some kind of mathematician. I studied physics but I made a turn in my career and
devoted myself to programming and, more specifically, to machine learning and AI programming. Currently, I am carrying out a doctorate in engineering in applications of neural networks
for embedded hardware in the automotive sector. 

I consider myself a dynamic person with a high level of curiosity. However, and due to that last point, I try to maintain a high degree of focus on current projects to avoid being lost in many tasks. I am a hard worker and I absolutely love programming and anything related to it (there are areas more preferred than others, of course). Currently I am trying to find a tema for Kaggle competitions, trying to improve communication skills with this blog and also developing  programming skills in general ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9875707/bcjuan), Github

Technically, I am interested, in a global scope, about machine learning, and more specifically, deep learning. I have worked mostly on computer vision problems but I would also love to tackle NLP.

## Current Projects

+ 2D Gesture Recognition with capacitive sensors
+ 3D Gesture Recognition with capacitive sensors
+ Automatic NAS with Gaussian processes for embedded hardware
